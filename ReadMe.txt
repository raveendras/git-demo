Hello GIT World !

New Update to my "ReadMe" file.

Overview
In my course, **Git Going Fast** -- I provide a one hour crash course that walks you through the key concepts all the way to working with remote repositories on *GitHub*. I have designed this course with the busy professional in mind. I breeze through theory and academics so we can dive right into the action. All I ask is just about an hour of your time and I will show you everything you need to know about *Git* to productively start your journey.
